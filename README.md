smartFarmer is a Python based machine learning application created for predicting the data regarding crops.
Currently two supervised learning modules has been implemented.
  - With given enviromental factors a optimal crop is predicted for grow.
  - With given enviromental factors for a crop yield is predicted. 
  

### File system

  - app.py : web interface to yield prediction 
  - app_classify.py : web interface to crop prediction
  - classification.py : data training of crop prediction
  - model.py : data training of yield prediction
